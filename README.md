===============================================

## Project
Build an alarm that wakes you up with a slap in your face and turns off after you turn on the lights of your bedroom.

### Objectives
- Apply the theory learned from microcontroller and applications course of Federal University of SÃ£o Carlos.
- Build something fun and appealing to children's computer learning.

### Platforms
- Arduino (for testing)
- Spark Core

### Components
- DC motor
- Arduino Mega 2560
- Spark Core
- Grove starter kit plus (Relay shield, Base shield and Light sensor)
- General electronic components (resistors, capacitors, etc)
