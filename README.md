aSlap: an alarm to wake you up with a slap in your face!
===============================================

## Project
Build an alarm that wakes you up with a slap in your face and turns off after you turn on the lights of your bedroom.

### Objectives
- Apply the theory learned during the Microcontrollers and Applications course;
- Build something fun and appealing to us students;
- Prevent you from missing classes and therefore getting better grades.

### Platforms
- Arduino (for initial testing);
- Spark Core.

### Components
- DC motor;
- Arduino Mega 2560;
- Spark Core;
- Grove starter kit plus (Relay shield, Base shield and Light sensor);
- General electronic components (resistors, capacitors, etc).

## To Do
- [X] Create a suitable development environment for the project;
- [X] Test and validate DC motor;
- [X] Test and validate the grove light sensor;
- [X] Test and validate the grove Relay;
- [X] Test and validate the grove Sound Buzzer;
- [X] Integrate light sensor, Relay, DC motor and Sound Buzzer;
- [X] Create circuit schematic;
- [X] Test and validate wi-fi connection on Spark Core;
- [X] Implement the alarm code for the Spark Core;
- [X] Create an html file to setup and control the alarm;
- [X] Integrate alarm code and initial tests code;

## Extras
- [x] Create an android App;
- [ ] Update/finalize the README.md to share this repository;
