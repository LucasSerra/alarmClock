aSlap: an alarm to wake you up with a slap in your face!
===============================================

## Project
Build an alarm that wakes you up with a slap in your face and turns off after you turn on the lights of your bedroom.

### Objectives
- Apply the theory learned during the Microcontrollers and Applications course;
- Build something fun and appealing to us students;
- Prevent you from missing classes and therefore getting better grades.

### Platforms
- Arduino (for initial testing);
- Spark Core.

### Components
- DC motor;
- Arduino Mega 2560;
- Spark Core;
- Grove starter kit plus (Relay shield, Base shield and Light sensor);
- General electronic components (resistors, capacitors, etc).

## To Do
- [X] Create a suitable development environment for the project;
- [X] Test and validate DC motor;
- [X] Test and validate the grove light sensor;
- [X] Test and validate the grove Relay;
- [X] Integrate light sensor and Relay;
- [X] Integrate light sensor, Relay and DC motor;
- [X] Create circuit schematic;
- [ ] Test and validate wi-fi connection on Spark Core;
- [ ] Implement an alarm using Spark Core;
- [ ] Create an html file to setup and control the alarm.

## Extras
- [ ] Create android App;
- [ ] Update/finalize the README.md to share this repository;
- [ ] Make the alarm usable in a iluminated ambient;
- [ ] Implement snooze functionality.
